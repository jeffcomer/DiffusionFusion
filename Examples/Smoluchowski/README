# This will take 10-15 minutes to run.

# While it's running you can check convergence:
bash costEvolution.sh smolCoarse_16ps.log
xmgrace smolCoarse_16ps.costUpdate.dat &

# You can also see what the D(z) profiles are doing as they are written.
xmgrace smolCoarse_16ps.{0..9}.diffuse &

# When it's done, you can calculate the posterior distribution (best guess for D(z)).
tclsh metroPosterior.tcl smolCoarse_16ps.traj coarse_oneHundred.dat 1000 1 post_smolCoarse_16ps
xmgrace post_smolCoarse_16ps.diffuse.dat &

# For fractional diffusivity:
../../diffusionFusion fracCoarse_16ps.fusion > fracCoarse_16ps.log
# This is much slower. diffusionFusion will automatically use all cores if you have them. "diffusionFusion -nt 2" sets the number of cores to 2.
